### What things make TDD failure?

-   Underestimating the learning curve
-   Confusing `TDD` with `unit-testing`
-   Think that `TDD` is enought but it isn't (needs Integration)
-   Not Starting with failing test
-   Not refactoring enough

What's happen if I write test after write logic code?

-   I write test to fit my source-code not my requirements!
