I just share software development best-practices in any aspect of development such as back-end, front-end , database, deployment, testing, etc. in this repo.

You must choose your js-code style before writing any lines of code. There are three types of popular code-syles here:

1. [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
2. [Google](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/jsguide.html)
3. [Github](https://github.com/standard/standard)
